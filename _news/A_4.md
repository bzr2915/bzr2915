Abstract: The escalated intricacy of analog circuits, compounded by the high-dimensional nature of the design space, introduces complexities in optimizing circuit performance. Since the evaluation cost, often through circuit simulation, is resource-intensive and time-consuming, it is crucial to obtain a feasible design with a decent Figure of Merit (FOM) value within a limited simulation budget. In this study, we conduct an in-depth review and analysis of cutting-edge exploration and exploitation techniques developed to address the intricacies encountered in analog circuit design automation. Moreover, to enable algorithmic comparisons and advance the state of the field, we provide benchmarks encompassing analog circuit netlists with high-dimensional design variables, which empower researchers to rigorously assess and refine their optimization algorithms, leading to enhanced efficacy and novel developments.
